<h2>About S7<a class="headerlink" href="#about-s7" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The purpose of this page is to provide an intro to S7 along with the rationale
for choosing it, aimed at people with some lisp familiarity. Those interested in
lisp related languages in general may find this interesting - regular users can skip it.</p>
<p>S7 Scheme is a minimal scheme designed specifically for embedding in music contexts,
made by Bill Schottstaedt at CCRMA. It’s the scheme engine in the Common Music and Grace
algorithmic composition platforms, the Snd library, and the Radium editor.
S7 is mostly R4RS Scheme, along with extras features chosen for the specific use
case of scripting music and audio in a host application.
In brief, it was chosen for Scheme For Max because:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>It has a feature set that maps well to our problem space</p></li>
<li><p>It’s multi-threaded such that we can have multiple interpreters in Max patches</p></li>
<li><p>It’s fast, small, and easy to hack on</p></li>
<li><p>It has a permissive (BSD) license, so it can be used in stand-alones and M4L devices</p></li>
</ul>
<p>S7 was based originally on TinyScheme, and is quite similar to Guile. In addition
to most of the standard Scheme linguistic features, it has a number of features also seen in
Common Lisp and shared with lisp relatives like Clojure. In some ways it’s a bit
of a hybrid: the syntax is clearly Scheme, but it does not have hygeinic macros
using syntax-case or syntax-rules, preferring Common Lisp style macros,
and it has various other features that aren’t in all all Scheme implementations.</p>
<p>Features of note for our use case include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Scheme simplicity (one namespace, tail call optimization, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Keywords</p></li>
<li><p>Applicative syntax</p></li>
<li><p>First class environments</p></li>
<li><p>Common Lisp style macros</p></li>
<li><p>Simple FFI</p></li>
<li><p>Used in music (Common Music, etc)</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="advantages-of-s7">
<h2>Advantages of S7<a class="headerlink" href="#advantages-of-s7" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The remainder of this page goes into more detail on the decision to use S7 and
its drivers, and may or may not be of interest to the reader.</p>
<div class="section" id="our-use-case">
<h3><strong>Our Use Case</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#our-use-case" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In order to evaluate whether S7’s feature set is a good one for Scheme
For Max, let’s examine our use case. The goal here is to
make building and extending music systems in Max easier, more
flexible, and smaller (in code). I anticipate most users are going to be working
in teams of one to a few people, and making many similar projects rather
than working on one large and continually growing codebase.
Given this, issues around onboarding new developers are not likely to be relevant.
The code should be easy to learn, but only if this can be done without
sacrificing power and expressiveness. We don’t need to be accessible to the
casual or beginning programmer - that niche is already well filled by the
JS object. We want a system that enables a sufficiently motivated
developer to express themselves as succinctly and flexibly as possible.
They should be able to build a re-usable toolkit flexible enough to use
in a wide variety of artistic contexts. And the resulting code
should be small, with very minimal syntax, allowing us to embed
and manipulate code in Max messages.</p>
<p>A further thought is that in music hacking, we have two very different creation
times: creating the system vs. creating the artistic product. When
we are creating the system, we want the most advanced tools we can
get our hands on, as the semantic and grammar problems of music are,
compared to business applications for example, rather fierce.
(I spent 15 years doing business application development, for what
that’s worth…) On the other hand, when we are creating the artistic product, we
want the code to “just get out of the way”. Any barrier to expression
slows down the artistic process. This is, in a nutshell, the reason
advanced languages like Lisp and Haskell are great for music, the developer
can used advanced tools to make a very smart engine, that is then
“played” with a high level and expressive domain specific language.</p>
<p>Ok, with that pontificating out of the way, let’s look at the features of S7
and how they fit in with our needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scheme-simplicity">
<h3><strong>Scheme Simplicity</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#scheme-simplicity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Being a Scheme, S7 has a single name space, tail call optimization, and
named let, among other things. These lead to recursive code that is smaller
and easier to read than Common Lisp, in my personal opinion. (Cue the drum-beats
of the religious war in 3..2..1..)
In many ways, S7 Scheme is a Scheme implementation with a bunch of Common Lisp’s
best features baked in.  Whether this is a <em>good</em> thing I think depends on
your taste and use case.  I happen to believe that everything I’ve seen
in S7 makes sense for our use case. As discussed above,
we’re after small, clear code, that can be changed quickly, even if one
must have a fair degree of language familiarity to read it easily.
Scheme’s recursion idioms fall in this category.
We can point the user at <a class="reference external" href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/little-schemer-fourth-edition">“The Little Schemer”</a>,
and when they come back, they’ll be happily writing tiny code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="keywords">
<h3><strong>Keywords</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#keywords" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Keywords (in lisps that support them) are symbols that always evaluate
to themselves. In S7, these are symbols starting with a colon.
Keyowrds are really useful in situations
where one is doing a lot of dynamic evaluation, as we are doing when
we pass over the Max-Scheme boundary. We need never worry about whether
we ought to be quoting a keyword, or what it will become after evaluation,
it just stays a keyword. In most places (aside from object scripting names), Max
is happy to accept keywords as symbols, and the resulting Max code is very
readable because it’s clear at a glance what a message
with a keyword will be when in Scheme. I’m using them wherever I can
and it’s definitely helping readability.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="applicative-syntax">
<h3><strong>Applicative Syntax</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#applicative-syntax" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Applicative syntax allows us to use data structures in the function
slots of s-expressions, with arguments to get their contents. In
S7 we can do this automatically with lists, vectors, and hash-tables.
This makes for some terse code, a good thing when we want to build things
in Max messages.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="first-class-environments">
<h3><strong>First class environments</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#first-class-environments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In S7, environments are first class objects, meaning we can easily
capture lexical bindings and pass them around. Again, we’re doing
a lot of dynamic evaluation as we cross the boundary, so it’s helpful
to be able to have this degree of control. It will also be useful as we
add more objects to Scheme For Max, with the ability to control
their executing environment, potentially sharing them or passing them
between environments.
Environments are also used in S7 to prevent hygeine issues in macros…</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cl-macros">
<h3><strong>CL Macros:</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#cl-macros" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>S7 only supports Common Lisp style macros, with <strong>defmacro</strong> and <strong>gensym</strong>.
It does not do syntax-case or syntax-rules Scheme/Racket style macros.
While it would be nice to have syntax-case and/or syntax-rules as well,
if only for uptake from the broader scheme community to have,
I think the Common Lisp style makes much more sense for our use case.
They are arguably easier to learn,
and can arguably be more powerful, at the cost of some chance of hygeine issues.
For easy creation of DSLs, on small code bases, in small teams, I think (presently…)
defmacro wins. They are also used in Clojure, Common Lisp, and Elixir,
from whom I hope to attract users.
Also with S7’s first-class environments, macro-hygeine is not a big concern
- details on this are in the S7 reference page for the macro enthusiast.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="simple-ffi-and-embedding">
<h3><strong>Simple FFI and embedding</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#simple-ffi-and-embedding" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Embedding S7 is a snap: there’s one C file to build
and link, and one header file to include. And the S7 FFI is
really easy to use. It’s simple to define Scheme
functions from C, and to build Scheme expressions to hand to the functions
in C. This has proved tremendously helpful for the rather cumbersome tasks
of taking Max’s concept of a list of atoms and converting it to a valid Scheme</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>sexp and vice versa.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Further, one of the project goals is to enable people to hack on Scheme For Max
itself, and after looking at the embedding story for Chicken, Chez, Gambit, and Racket,
I realized this would make a big difference to the accessibility of the code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-in-music">
<h3><strong>Use in music</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#use-in-music" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Another big advantage of S7 is its use in music circles already.
Common Music, by Heinrich Taube, is a very mature algorithmic composition toolkit
with a rich library of music related functions that will be helpful to
users. This library depends a lot on S7’s lisp-y-ness, leaning heavily
on various Common Lisp macros. Prof. Taube also has an excellent book,
“Notes From The Metalevel”, with a wonderfully clear intro to Scheme and Lisp
specifically with musical examples that will be applicable to Max.
One goal of the project is to ensure that the learner can use this book
as a reference, and that people using Common Music outside of Max can
easily port code to a Max environment. Common Music’s application, Grace,
is built with the JUCE toolkit, and examples on this are available.
I felt this would be very valuable in encouraging adoption in music hackers.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="disadvantages-of-s7">
<h2>Disadvantages of S7<a class="headerlink" href="#disadvantages-of-s7" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Of course, S7 has some disadvantages too.</p>
<p>It’s not well known, being used in a small specialist community.
Adoption in the larger scheme world has not been a priority of the project,
as its purpose is specifically to enable advanced academic computer music.
Community involvement in the development process has not been a priority,
which one might consider a good or bad thing depending on your take.</p>
<p>The documentation is very sparse, and not beginner friendly - it’s definitely not
got docs suitable for someone just learning Scheme. On the other hand, the
docs have extensive examples of embedding in C and using the FFI,
which was extremely helpful and which few others had.</p>
<p>It’s a bit of a hybrid, and thus does not try to hew to the R7RX standards.
It’s mosly R5RS, some R7RS, but meeting R7RS small is not a goal of the project.
This means some people looking for a general purpose scheme are going to prefer
implementations working towards R7RS, such as Chicken or Guile.</p>
<p>On the whole, after looking at the options, I came to the conclusion that
the advantages significantly outweighed the disadvantages for the stated
goals of the project. Documentation and community facing
material can be written much more easily than one can improve another scheme implementation,
and if development becomes an issue, there is always the
option of writing a thin layer on top of S7 to act as an abstraction between
upstream and the scheme used in Scheme For Max. This approach has been taken
successfully in many open source projects before, and may well make sense at some
time in the future if we wind up adding features to S7 that are not of interest
to the main S7 project.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-options-considered">
<h2>Other Options Considered<a class="headerlink" href="#other-options-considered" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When beginning the project, I looked for quite a while at many Scheme and
Lisp options. If you care about that sort of thing, you might find this interesting.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Clojure</p></li>
<li><p>Guile</p></li>
<li><p>Chicken</p></li>
<li><p>Gambit</p></li>
<li><p>Chez</p></li>
<li><p>Racket</p></li>
<li><p>Embeddable Common Lisp</p></li>
<li><p>Clojure/ClojureScript</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Below are my subjective thoughts in case anyone wants to try porting
Scheme For Max to another Scheme. (I’d love to see the results if you do!)
None of the others have extensive computer music (with the exception of Common
Lisp) so I won’t even list that as a disadvantage - take it as given.</p>
<div class="section" id="clojure">
<h3><strong>Clojure</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#clojure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Clojure is it’s own lisp-like langauge, that runs on the Java Virtual Machine.
It has a lot of adoption, with the resuting rich library of books and
documentation resources. However, it only runs on the Java Virtual Machine or
on Node.js as ClojureScript. My first attempt at this project was with
with ClojureScript on Node For Max. Overall, I really like the language, but
the ties to the JVM make it unsuitable for embedding or for low latency
native use. ClojureScipt on Node for Max works, but runs in a separate process
that Max communicates with under the hood with serialization over a network
connection. As a result, the level of integration possible is minimal
compared to something embedded in a C external.</p>
<p>There are some native or compile-to-c languages influenced by Clojure that
look promising, such as Ferret, Fennel, Janet, and Carp. However, none of
them are as mature as S7 at this point, and would give us the disadvantages
of S7 (docs, community size) without the computer music world maturity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="guile">
<h3><strong>Guile</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#guile" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Guile is a very nice minimal, embeddable scheme. It’s easy to embed,
is very modern, and has excellent documentation. It’s under very
active development, though mostly by one person. It’s pretty small.
The main disadvantages of Guile are that it uses a less permissive license.
If S7 weren’t around, version 1 would probably be Guile. Like S7
Guile is just an interperter, making the FFI situation pretty simple.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="chicken">
<h3><strong>Chicken</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#chicken" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Chicken is a modern (R7RS) scheme that compiles to C. It’s got fantastic
docs, a great module system with lots of libraries, and a really great community.
It’s popular as a scheme to build real-world products in for business
and scientific applications. Unfortunately, it’s not multi-thread safe
out of the box, and the FFI docs were minimal. The embedding situation is also
not as simple as Guile or S7, as it’s both compiler and interpreter.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="gambit">
<h3><strong>Gambit</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#gambit" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Gambit is a large, mature, industrial strenth Scheme.
It compiles down to highly performant C, and supports many kinds
of macros. Gambit was another high contender. The big issue for Gambit
was lack of documentation on embedding and a much more difficult embedding story.
I will likely try to get Gambit working out of curiosity, there are
some interesting developments in Gambit such as compiling to JavaScript.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="chez">
<h3><strong>Chez</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#chez" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Chez is similar to Gambit, in that it’s a big, industrial grade Scheme,
with high performance. Racket is being redone on top of Chez. Also like
Gambit, the embedding and FFI story scared me off pretty quickly.
I would use Gambit or Chez if I were starting a commercial product
on Scheme and expected to be on it for a long time, with a team, building
tons of code. They are like the Common Lisps of Scheme.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="racket">
<h3><strong>Racket</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#racket" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Racket was originally called PLT Scheme, and came out of the academic side
of scheme. It has a very advanced macro system, and fairly accessible
syntax. Unfortunately, it changes a lot (currently being redone on Chez)
and embedding is not a high priority. It can be done, but it looks
very cumbersome. Racket also does not support Common Lisp macros with defmacro,
which I wanted. It does have fantastic documentation though!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="gerbil">
<h3><strong>Gerbil</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#gerbil" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Gerbil is a modern “opinionated” (their words!) scheme built on top
of Gambit. It does not support defmacro macros. It is aimed at system
programming primarily. By the time I looked at Gerbil closely, I was
pretty sure I wanted defmacro. It does look like somethin worth looking
at more closely however for other Scheme uses.</p>
<p>Overall, after several months of evaluation, S7 was elected. If this document
piques interest in others who wish to try something similar or port the project
to another Scheme/Lisp, I would certainly be interested in communicating.</p>
